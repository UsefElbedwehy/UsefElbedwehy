# Youssef Elbedwehy - Embedded Engineer

## Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm Youssef Elbedwehy, a mechatronics engineering student at Mansoura University. I am passionate about embedded systems and enjoy working with microcontrollers. Currently, I am focusing on learning ARM Cortex-M architecture, building upon my previous experience with AVR microcontrollers.

## Learning Journey
I believe in continuous learning and professional growth. Currently, I am expanding my knowledge and skills in ARM Cortex-M architecture. Some of the topics I am studying include:

- Understanding the ARM Cortex-M architecture and its features.
- ARM assembly language programming for Cortex-M microcontrollers.
- Developing firmware and applications using ARM Cortex-M development tools and IDEs.
- Interfacing peripherals and sensors with ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

## Contact
I'm always open to collaboration and learning from others in the embedded systems community. If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to discuss potential projects or collaborations, feel free to reach out to me. You can connect with me on LinkedIn at [Youssef Elbedwehy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usefelbedwehy) or email me at [elbedwehyy@gmail.com](mailto:elbedwehyy@gmail.com).

Let's explore the fascinating world of embedded systems together and create innovative solutions using ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers!
